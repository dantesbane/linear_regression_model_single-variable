This is a simple univariate linear regression model where we have one input variable for the output. 
In linear regression we have to implement the best line fit for the scatter plot which is done using the gradient descent algorithm.
The gradient descent algorithm helps us in determining the parameters w and b whihc will fit the training data of our linear regression model
